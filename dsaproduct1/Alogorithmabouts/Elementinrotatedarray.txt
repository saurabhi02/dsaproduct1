take a while loop  until l<=h 
low as 0 igh as n-1 
find the mid element and check if key is equal to mid or not 
now from this point updated binary search will work 
it is sure that one part of the array will be sorted 
40 50 60 70 10 20 30  is the array key is 60 

now if a[l]<a[mid ] then the left part is sorted we will chech if the elemt we are looking for fall under the range of 
a[l] to a[mid]
if yes then we will update high to mid -1 

if no we will update in low  =mid + 1

if a[l]>a[mid] then the right part would be sorted 
we will check if the element is greater then a[mid] and less then a[high]
if yes low = mid+1;

other wise high would be mid- 1
